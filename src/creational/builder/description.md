## Description

The builder pattern is a creational pattern that simplify the creation of an instance of a class
that have a complex constructor by adding descriptive methods and most times abstracting the creation of
another objects that composes the subject class.

### NOTE

The implementation example was made with a instance class builder, but it can made with a static class as well (what simplifies the usage)
